Journal 7

A frustrating but rewarding day.  I have been going pretty much non-stop for about 13 hours today including lecture.
I came a real long way in knowing how to manipulate the DOM.  This was something I completely missed my first time through.
There is still something not fully connecting, but I know I am close.

The logic portion of this stuff is my jam.  Getting stuff to fire with HTML is not my jam.  Seems like a painstaking
process of just doing random stuff to get your webpage right.  Either way, I know I have to learn it, just need more 
time here.

So far reviewing 201 has been fantastic.
