Styling is a good challenge for me.  It's not something I am especially good at, so it's an interesting challenge.  I still get a bit confused on how various positions affect different html containers.  I am sure I will get more comfortable as the more I do it.  Otherwise, I am really working on the logic side of things.  Additionally, I now have a better concept of what's required on each individual assignment and I'll be diligent going forward.

All in all, this week has been a huge confidence builder for me and my ability to be a coder.
