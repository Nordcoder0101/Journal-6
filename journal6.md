Journal 6

Already super glad to be retaking this course.  It took me about 30 mins to do what took me multiple hours a couple
weeks ago.  With a stronger skill set I am trying to challenge myself to find more efficient ways of solving these problems
than I did previously.

Super happy week 1 is wrapped up for me from a homework perspective and it's full steam ahead from here.  Hoping to be 
a strong resource for this class if they need it.  I learn most it seems when I have to teach something.
