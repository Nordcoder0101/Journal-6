Today was super rewarding when I finally got full functionality on my project.  It still needs some style, but the
code is working.  When I did this project the first time I was in tears and feeling like the dumbest person to ever
try and learn to code.  This time I got through Salmon Cookies with little help, and it feels AWESOME!!!!

Feeling really frustrated with my assignment submittal comments.  It seems like there is always something messed
up in GitHub or some other issue with my assignments.  This is one of the biggest reasons why 201 was so hard
for me the first time through.  I kept and still keep getting random weird issues thar are preventing you from
being able to see my work.  

I can't tell you how frustrating this is to still have these problems.
